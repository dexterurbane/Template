If installing from a tarball: simply run the usual configure/make/install
procedure, using the desired options to configure (type "configure --help" for a
list).

> ./configure
> make
> sudo make install

If running from e.g. a source distribution cloned from git, you should first
run autogen.sh before performing the steps above.

> autogen.sh

You will need an up to date version of GNU autotools.
